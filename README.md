## Purpose:
#### This project focuses on implementing the use of stoichiometry in Python. So far, this program only has the ability to count the number of elements in each compound, and determine if a reaction is balanced or not.
---
## Usage:
#### To use this program, Compound.py is run in a Terminal window or some equivalent. The user inputs 3 compounds, the first 2 of which are to be the reactants, and the last one being a product.
#### From there, the number of each element in the reactants and product is printed out, as well as the reaction itself. Whether or not the equation is balanced is also printed out at that moment.

## Future Ideas:
#### There are 3 specific ideas that I wish to accomplish at some point, even after Capstone is over:
* Implement balancing unbalanced reactions
* Determine the limiting reactant from balanced reactions  
* Be able to give the user information such as molecular mass, atomic number, and atomic mass
